Tron is a blockchain-based decentralized platform that aims to construct a global free content entertainment system. The protocol is that each user can freely publish store and own data in the decentralized autonomous form, decides the subscription, distribution, and push of contents and enables creators by releasing circulation and dealing with digital assets, thus forming a decentralized entertainment ecosystem.

It was founded in 2017 by a Singapore based non-profit organization called the Tron Foundation. It is headed by CEO Justin Sun, a Chinese student who previously worked for Ripple(XRP).

The main goal of TRON is to eliminate the middle man, i.e., to bridge the gap between the content creators and the content consumers by using the features of blockchain and peer to peer network technology. This would result in overall cost reduction for the consumers and improved collection of receipts for the producers, which offer a win-win situation for both the party.

To compare it with a real-world application, consider Amazon Prime Video, which operates a digital service entertainment platform offering on-demand content where creators can publish their content at a fee, and consumers can watch their content at a subscription fee. Here a single organization controls the services in a centralized manner, and often, the middle man takes a significant share.

Tron business model is likely the same but based on a public blockchain network where it acts as a distributed, decentralized storage facility that makes it more cost-effective and more efficient. Its main aim is to eliminate the middle man, like Amazon Prime Video, in the above example, by allowing anyone and everyone to host its digital entertainment content on its blockchain-based network. The global audience can pay directly to the content creators for the content they want to watch.

In the process, Tron's open, decentralized platform and distributed storage technology also attempts to address a significant issue - the challenge of a very few, and powerful corporations running the internet and its content - making it a level playing field.

> <b>What is Tron Future RoadMap?</b>

The developers of Tron have already made a plan for the currency. The idea that starts in 2017 and ends in 2027 containing six stages, starting from Exodus to Eternity. Various stages are:-<br/>

a) Exodus - Currently, Tron is in this phase. In this phase, Tron will provide a free peer to peer platform for distributing and sharing content related to the entertainment industry.<br/>

b) Odyssey - In this phase, the economic incentives would be put in place to encourage content creation and empowerment. During this stage, users of Tron would be able to make a transaction using Tron.<br/>

c) Great Voyage - This phase would deal with a significant number of issues like income payment, dividend management, and the management of devoted supporters.<br/>

d) Apollo - In this phase, Tron would be able to issue its token by letting the producer of content create its token. This would increase the economic vitality of the system.<br/>

e) Star Trek - The content platform would be transformed into a decentralized gaming platform. Considering the profitability in the current gaming market, this phase would provide commendable market capitalization to Tron.<br/>

f) Eternity - Eternity would allow developers to crowdfund their game development by letting people invest in the games they have an interest in and have a say in the future of the gaming market.<br/>

> <b>What Is Tronix (TRX)?</b>

The Tron network uses its cryptocurrency called TronX (TRX). One can buy TronX in exchange, like Zebpay and WazirX.

TronX can be used by content consumers to pay for the content they want to access. These coins will go to content producer accounts, where they can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies, or can be used to pay for other blockchain services.

> <b>Does TRON have a future?</b>

It is a well-known fact that the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile. Hence it is tough to pinpoint the future of Tron.<br/>

However, as far as speculations are concerned, Tron seems to have a reasonably prosperous future ahead as it has vast potential, mainly because of its active community, and it is continuously getting adjusted with the latest trends.

> <b>Conclusion</b>

Tron's clearly outlined long-term vision with date-tagged milestones, and the increasing popularity of digital content with the promise of lower costs makes it a promising endeavor in the blockchain space. Its prospects are also boosted by a solid backing of wealthy and established Chinese investors.

It will be interesting to see how Tron evolves to meet these expectations.
